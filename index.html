    <p>Home Alone is a 1990 American comedy film directed by Chris Columbus and written and produced by John Hughes. It is the first film in the Home Alone franchise, and stars Macaulay Culkin, Joe Pesci, Daniel Stern, John Heard, and Catherine O'Hara. Culkin plays Kevin McCallister, a boy who defends his suburban Chicago home from burglars after his family accidentally leaves him behind on their Christmas vacation to Paris.

      Hughes conceived Home Alone while preparing to go on vacation. Warner Bros. originally intended to finance and distribute the film, but shut down production after it exceeded its assigned budget, and 20th Century Fox assumed responsibilities following secret meetings with Hughes. Columbus and Culkin were hired soon afterwards, and filming took place between February and May 1990 on location across Illinois.
      
      Home Alone premiered in Chicago on November 10, 1990, and was theatrically released in the United States on November 16. It received positive reviews, with praise for its cast, humor, and music. Home Alone grossed $476.7 million worldwide, becoming the highest-grossing live-action comedy until the release of The Hangover Part II (2011), and made Culkin a child star. It was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy, and Best Actor in a Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy for Culkin, and for the Academy Award for Best Original Score for John Williams, and Best Original Song for "Somewhere in My Memory". Home Alone has since been considered one of the best Christmas films.[3][4] A sequel, Home Alone 2: Lost in New York, was released in 1992.</p>

    <p>Home Alone 2: Lost in New York is a 1992 American comedy film directed by Chris Columbus and written and produced by John Hughes. It is the sequel to Home Alone (1990), and is the second film in the Home Alone franchise. The film stars Macaulay Culkin, Joe Pesci, Daniel Stern, John Heard, Tim Curry, Brenda Fricker, and Catherine O'Hara. It follows Kevin McCallister (Culkin), as he is separated from his family on their holiday vacation, this time in New York City.

      Hughes finished writing the film by February 1991, after signing a six-picture deal with 20th Century Fox. Culkin's return was confirmed in May, and the rest of the cast was finalized soon after. Principal photography took place between December 1991 and May 1992, and was done on location in Illinois and New York, including at the Rockefeller Center and the original World Trade Center.
      
      Home Alone 2: Lost in New York was theatrically released in the United States on November 20, 1992. It received mixed reviews from critics; while the performances were praised, criticism was levelled towards its darker tone, use of violence and similarities to the first film. The film grossed over $359 million worldwide, becoming the third highest-grossing film of 1992, after The Bodyguard and Aladdin. A sequel with a new cast, Home Alone 3, was released in 1997.</p>

    <p>Home Alone 3 is a 1997 American family comedy film written and produced by John Hughes. It is the third film in the Home Alone franchise and the first not to feature actor Macaulay Culkin and the cast from the previous films, nor director Chris Columbus and composer John Williams. It is also the final film in the Home Alone franchise to receive a theatrical release. The film is directed by Raja Gosnell (in his directorial debut), who served as the editor of both original films. It stars Alex D. Linz as Alex Pruitt, an 8-year-old child prodigy who defends his home from a dangerous band of criminals working for an infamous terrorist organization.

      The film was followed by a made-for-television sequel, Home Alone 4: Taking Back the House, in 2002.</p>

    <p>Home Alone 4: Taking Back the House is a 2002 American made-for-television Christmas family comedy film directed by Rod Daniel, which first aired on ABC on November 3, 2002, followed by a DVD release on September 2, 2003. The fourth installment in the Home Alone franchise, the film stars Mike Weinberg, French Stewart, Missi Pyle, Jason Beghe, Erick Avari, Barbara Babcock, Joanna Going, and Clare Carey. This is the first film in the Home Alone franchise to not receive a theatrical release.

      Whereas Home Alone 3 featured a standalone plot and new characters, this film brings back several of the main characters from the first two films, including Kevin McCallister, but with all of the roles played by different actors. The plot revolves around Kevin McCallister trying to defend his future stepmother's house from his old nemesis Marv and his sidekick/wife Vera. It was the last film that Rod Daniel directed before his subsequent retirement (partly due to his diagnosis from Parkinson's disease, complications of which resulted in his death in 2016).</p>
